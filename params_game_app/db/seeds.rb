# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

## Assignment:
# • Create a brand new app called `params_game_app` where you can use query parameters to tell the app 
#your name, and the app will show your name on the screen in all caps.
# ```rails new params_game_app```
# • Next make it so that if your name begins with the letter “a”, there’s a message that appears saying, “Hey, your name starts with the first letter of the alphabet!”
# • Create the guess-a-number game using query parameters. (Reminder: This is the game where the app chooses a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess what it is. It also tells the user after each guess whether to guess higher or lower.)
# One caveat: Instead of having the program choosing a random number in advance, just choose a specific number, such as 36.
