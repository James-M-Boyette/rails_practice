# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

#Assignment 1: Simple Input for Seed file - attempting to populate contact list without Faker Gem ... and then with faker gem
# require "faker"

# contact = []
# 100.times do
#   contact << { first_name: "James", last_name: "Boyette", email: "james.boyette@gmail.com", phone_number: "646 831 0253" }
# end

# pp contact

# Faker::Name.name
# pp Faker

#Your mini_capstone will need a route to show all products and a route to show an individual product. What steps are necessary to implement this?
# Restated:

# one route that shows an individual product
# What will this require?
